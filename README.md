# Aeq FFA Detector
This contains the client and the server for the ffa detector aeq is using<br>
This git is divided in 2 branches, why? So that i dont close the client in my container when i do a pull/clone, and also because it's more tidy.<br>
Credits to:
- TechAle (NoCatsNoLife) for coding
- Peter for checking that my code would not ban the entire aeq
